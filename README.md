## 📐 Power BI & DAX

### Key DAX Measures

**KPIs:**
```dax
Completed Bookings = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNT('bookings'[Booking ID]),
    'bookings'[Booking Status] = "Success"
)

Total Distance = SUM('bookings'[Ride Distance (km)])

Avg Distance = AVERAGE('bookings'[Ride Distance (km)])
```

**Customer Segmentation:**
```dax
Ride Frequency = 
VAR _rides = 
    CALCULATE(
        COUNT(bookings[Booking ID]),
        ALLEXCEPT(bookings, bookings[Customer ID])
    )
RETURN
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        _rides = 1, "New Customer",
        _rides <= 3, "Occasional",
        _rides <= 6, "Frequent",
        "Loyal"
    )
```

**Time Slot Analysis:**
```dax
Time Slot = 
VAR _hour = HOUR('bookings'[Time])
RETURN
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        _hour >= 9 && _hour < 12, "09 AM - 12 PM",
        _hour >= 12 && _hour < 15, "12 PM - 03 PM",
        -- Additional time slots...
        "Unknown"
    )
```
